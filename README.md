# ToDooey
A simple ToDo app for Android.

This helped to introduce me to the basics of Android and writing my own classes for a SQLite database.

# The user can:
- Add ToDo items
- Delete ToDo items
- Delete a single ToDo item
- Filter based on:
    - Completed
    - Not Completed
    - Today
    - All
-Use Preferences to hide any completed items within the 'All' section

Much more to come when I have the time :)
